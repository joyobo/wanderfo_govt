# Purpose of app:
- Allows the government to have control over the shops' permission to open/denied.
- Provides an easy way for the government to set the shops' permission by grouping shops into categories and instead, toggle the categories' permission which affects the permission of shops with that categories.

# How to use:
- The home page shows a list of categories (eg, food supply, aerospace). 
- The toggle buttons at the side indicate that category's permission. 
--"On" being that that category permission is allowed (shops with that category are allowed to open)
--"Off" being that that category permission is denied (shops with that category are not allowed to open)
- Toggle the buttons and click the Submit button.
- For shops with multiple categories, if ALL of those categories are the same (either all "On" or all "Off"), there is no conflicting categories permissions -> that shop does not fall under gray area
- For shops with multiple categories, if those categories have differing permissions, there is a conflict in categories permissions -> the shop falls under the gray area
- The next page shows a list of shops that fall under the gray area (if have). The toggle buttons are there so that you can manually set those shops' permission.
- Then, click the Done button.
